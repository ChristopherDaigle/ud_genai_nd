    "# What is a Foundation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A foundation model is a powerful AI tool that can do many different things after being trained on lots of diverse data. These models are incredibly versatile and provide a solid base for creating various AI applications, like a strong foundation holds up different kind of buildings. By using a foundation model, we have a strong starting point for building specialized AI tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terms Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Foundation Model**: A large AI model trained on a wide variety of data, which can do many tasks without much extra training.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adapted**: Modified or adjusted to suit new conditions or a new purpose, i.e. in the context of foundation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generalize**: The ability of a model to apply what it has learned from its training data to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundation models represent a paradigm shift in building machine learning systems. In the past, there was more of a focus on building large datasets and building models from scratch. With the advent of foundation models, the pattern has changed. Now, people generally start with the foundation model and build off of it."

    "\n",
    "Foundation Models and Traditional Models are two distinct approaches in the field of artificial intelligence with different strengths. Foundation Models, which are built on large, diverse datasets, have the incredible ability to adapt and perform well on many different tasks. In contrast, Traditional Models specialize in specific tasks by learning from smaller, focused datasets, making them more straightforward and efficient for targeted applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "The transformer architecture has revolutionized the way machines handle language by enabling the training of sequential data at scale. Thanks to this, today’s AI models are massive, with some having billions of parameters (or more) allowing for incredible flexibility across many tasks. The technology is exciting and holds great promise for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sequential data**: Information that is arranged in a specific order, such as words in a sentence or events in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Self-attention mechanism**: The self-attention mechanism in a transformer is a process where each element in a sequence computes its representation by attending to and weighing the importance of all elements in the sequence, allowing the model to capture complex relationships and dependencies.\n",

    "* Github\n",
    "* Wikipedia\n",
    "* Gutenberg project\n",

    "In this exercise, you will construct a fictional pre-training dataset for a fictional task. The goal is to get you thinking about how to construct a pre-training dataset for your own task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Evaluate the available pre-training datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by examining the four sources mentioned in the introduction - CommonCrawl, Github, Wikipedia, and the Gutenberg project. Assess the size, quality, and relevance of the data provided by each source for training language models.\n",

    "### Common Crawl\n",
    "\n",
    "Read about [CommonCrawl on its website](https://commoncrawl.org/)\n",
    "* Size: Common Crawl corpus contains petabytes of data, regularly collected since 2008\n",
    "* Data Summary: CommonCrawl website contains webpages in their original form, and these pages have not been filtered for things like spam\n",

    "* Size: There are over 70,000 books in the Gutenberg Project dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2. Select the appropriate datasets\n",
    "Based on the evaluation, choose the datasets that best suit the requirements of pre-training a Language Model (LLM). Consider factors such as the diversity of data, domain-specific relevance, and the specific language model objectives.\n",

You might say that Wikipedia is the second-best dataset because it contains a large amount of text, including some code. You might say that CommonCrawl is the third-best dataset because it contains a large amount of text, but the text is unstructured and noisy. You might say that the Gutenberg project is the worst dataset because it contains text that is not relevant to the task.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 3. Pre-process the selected datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the nature of the chosen datasets, pre-processing may be required. This step involves cleaning the data, removing irrelevant or noisy content, standardizing formats, and ensuring consistency across the dataset. Discuss how you would pre-process the datasets based on what you have observed.\n",

    "```\n",
    "I would start by examining the common crawl data set to understand how messy is messy, as it is described as such. I may do the same with Wikipedia\n",

    "\n",
    "For the Github data, I am unsure how it should be pre-processed.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4. Augment with additional sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider whether there are other relevant sources that can be used to augment the selected datasets. These sources could include domain-specific corpora, specialized text collections, or other publicly available text data that aligns with your language model's objectives, such as better representation and diversity."
