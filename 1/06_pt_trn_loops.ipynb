    "# PyTorch Training Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A PyTorch training loop is an essential part of building a neural network model, which helps us teach the computer how to make predictions or decisions based on data. By using this loop, we gradually improve our model's accuracy through a process of learning from its mistakes and adjusting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Terms Explained:\n",
    "**Training Loop:** The cycle that a neural network goes through many times to learn from the data by making predictions, checking errors, and improving itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batches:** Batches are small, evenly divided parts of data that the AI looks at and learns from each step of the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epochs:** A complete pass through the entire training dataset. The more epochs, the more the computer goes over the material to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss functions:** They measure how well a model is performing by calculating the difference between the model's predictions and the actual results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimizer:** Part of the neural network's brain that makes decisions on how to change the network to get better at its job."
